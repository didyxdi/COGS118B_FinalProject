# COGS118B Final Project - The Piazza Group

### Project Description:
Health outcomes are closely related to social factors. In this project, we explored the impact of demographic distribution data on hospital inpatient discharge rates by county groupings in Texas and projected future trends based on statistics from previous years. We first developed an autoregressive model based on population distribution data from 2013-2018 and used it to predict data for 2019. We then classified all counties into three health categories and trained both nonlinear neural network with sigmoid activation functions and linear neural network.
